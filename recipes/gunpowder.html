<p>Gunpowder, also commonly known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur, carbon (in the form of charcoal) and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The sulfur and carbon act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer.[1][2] Gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, building pipelines and road building.</p>
<p>The current standard composition for the gunpowder manufactured by pyrotechnicians was adopted as long ago as 1780. Proportions by weight are around 75% potassium nitrate (known as saltpeter or saltpetre), 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Saltepeter (Find "stump remover" in a garden store. May also be called niter or potassium nitrate.)</li>
    <li>Standard grill charcoal</li>
    <li>Sulfur (found at garden stores or online)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Finely grind all ingredients with a mortar and pestle separately.</li>
<li>Measure out 74.8% saltpeter, 13.3% charcoal, and 11.9% sulfur by weight.</li>
<li>Mix the ingredients together. Moisten for safety first, then grind with pestle for 10 or more minutes!</li>
<li>Store safely in a fireproof box outside your home!</li>
